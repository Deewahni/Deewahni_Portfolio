    <p>
        This system is a collaboration work. It initially stores data into the server. As the name implies, employee
        information management is its main purpose. A client has requested to have a system where employees upload their
        information required by the organization. From basic information to things like SSS, SAL-N and whatnots, to
        name a few.
        This system is designed to upload and store any document files such as word, excel, pdf, and images.
        <br>
        Since it is built to store individual information, we designed the system to have log-in/log-out setup
        where every individual has their own account. We made the layout as simple as possible so that the not-so-techy
        employees will not have hard time operating it. We also created a dashboard for the administrator of this sytem. 
        It's function is to be able to oversee and check all the important files uploaded as well as the information provided.
