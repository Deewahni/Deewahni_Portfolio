        <p>
            This system is a collaboration work. It initially stores data into the server. As the name implies, employee
            information management is its main purpose. A client has requested to have a system where employees upload their
            information required by the organization. From basic information to things like SSS, SAL-N and whatnots, to
            name a few.
            This system is designed to upload and store any document files such as word, excel, pdf, and images.
            <br>
            Since it is built to store individual information, we designed the system to have log-in/log-out setup
            where every individual has their own account. We made the layout as simple as possible so that the not-so-techy
            employees will not have hard time operating it. We also created a dashboard for the administrator of this sytem. 
            It's function is to be able to oversee and check all the important files uploaded as well as the information provided.
